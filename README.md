# *NYC Hyperlocal Air Quality Data Analysis - Spatial Join & Visualization*


This Assignment focuses on analyzing New York Cityâ€™s hyperlocal air quality data using Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, and Datascience Tables in a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab). The goal is to leverage table-based operations and spatial join techniques to combine air quality sensor readings with geographic data.

# *Objective*
This assignment reinforces concepts from Chapters 6 (Tables), 7 (Visualization), 8 (Functions & Tables), and 9 (Randomness) by:

Preprocessing air quality data: Performing spatial joins to link air pollution readings (NYC_PM.csv) with NYC neighborhoods (nyc_polygon.geojson).
Exploring the dataset: Using .show(), .column(), and .apply() to inspect and clean the data.
Computing summary statistics: Calculating mean, median, min, max for temperature, humidity, and PM2.5.
Grouping and aggregating data: Using .group() and .pivot() to analyze borough-wise pollution levels.
Visualizing insights: Creating bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms for air quality trends.
Categorizing air quality: Defining a function to classify PM2.5 levels into "Good", "Moderate", and "Unhealthy", then applying it to the dataset.
Simulating random sampling: Extracting random samples, computing mean PM2.5 values, and visualizing sample distributions.

# ðŸ› Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
GeoPandas (for spatial joins)
Datascience Tables (for table-based operations)
Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

# ðŸ“¥ How to Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.
Run the provided onboarding code to load necessary libraries.
Execute each task sequentially to process and analyze the dataset.
Review visualizations and results for insights on NYC air quality.
